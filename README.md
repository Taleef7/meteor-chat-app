## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is currently under development.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended, installed via nvm)
* [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/install)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Running Locally (WSL - Ubuntu)

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
